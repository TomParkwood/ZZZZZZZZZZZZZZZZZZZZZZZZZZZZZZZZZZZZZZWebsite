<p>What is a Big Pad?</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been in a classroom or attended a business meeting, you’ll be familiar with the whiteboard – sometimes little more than a mirror image of the old-fashioned blackboard.<br>
Things have come a long way since then, of course. Thanks to modern technology, the whiteboard converted to a large computer screen and, connected to a PC, laptop or projector, became interactive.<br>
But development has not stopped there. Several years ago now, the electronics company Sharp created the Big Pad – significantly expanding the interactive capabilities and quality of the whiteboard, so that it behaved just like a giant tablet or smartphone hung on the wall.<br>
Big Pads are large interactive touchscreens, which can be wirelessly connected to the internet and are capable of being connected to other devices – from PCs to laptops, or even smartphones and tablets.<br>
Providing the ultimate in interactive solutions, the Big Pad may provide the focus for a whole classroom of students, with up to 50 wirelessly connected devices, delivering a truly collaborative experience.<br>
The present generation of school children –familiar with the tablet and smartphone – the Big Pad and its technology already appears like a second home. But with these new interactive display products, they can all be linked with what is being shown to the whole of the class. They are given a chance to engage with everyone in the room, by projecting whatever they draw, write or wish to present on the large touchscreen at the front of the room.<br>
With access to their own images, videos, text and sound, the interactive whiteboard is immediately familiar, user-friendly and easy to use. It gives full rein to the creativity and imagination of every participant – whether in the classroom or boardroom.</p>
<p>The Big Pad may be the last word in interconnectivity, but it is also entirely self-contained – everything you need, hanging on the wall at the front of the class.<br>
It does not need to be connected to any other device – such as the PC, laptop or projector used in the past – but may be used entirely independently.<br>
The image remains crisp and sharp – and does not fade – over a life expectancy of a massive 50,000 hours of use. And since it consumes so little energy, it is cheap to run, too.<br>
User-friendliness allows everyone to participate. Content is not limited to whatever is beamed from a projector – the projector may become largely redundant when so many other interactive devices may be wirelessly connected to the giant screen at the front of the room.<br>
Having taken so easily to the interactive solutions afforded by the Big Pad, your class is likely to want to recap or to move on from where they left off in the last lesson.<br>
Keeping the record of past collaborative efforts is simply done by just wirelessly recording the work from the Big Pad or saving it to a USB stick – call it up again the next lesson and you can all resume from exactly where you left off. If you need a hard copy from any key parts of the lesson, these can be just as easily printed off through a wirelessly connected printer.<br>
<p>With all screens boasting touch screen with fast and responsive Infrared (IR) 10<sup>1</sup> point touch which means that up to four users can be interacting with one screen. As well as High Definition 1080p displays<sup>2</sup>.</p>

			<td style="width:70%;">The 60 inch range of Big Pads by Sharp is made up of three models the PN-60SC5, PN-60TB3 and the PN-TW3A. <br>The different models are designed for different scenarios so they all have slightly different features and functions built in. For example the PN-60SC5 was designed for education and office meeting rooms so it features freeze frame and blackout buttons which allows the presenter complete control over the screen, whereas the PN-60TW3A was designed for hospitals and office meeting rooms, so it has DICOM emulation mode which is used when reviewing radiological scans.</td>

					<li>One of the main differences between all three models is their connectivity options</li>
					<li>The PN-60TB3 has 3x HDMI, 1x DisplayPort, 2x Mini D-sub 15 pin, 2x 3.5mm audio jack and 2x USB ports as inputs. 2x 10W external speakers, 1x DisplayPort and 1x 3.5mm audio jack as outputs.</li>

					<li>One of the highly advertised points on the PN-60SC5 is its one-touch Freeze Frame and Blackout buttons, which aim to give the presenter more control over the screen. By being able to pause what is being shown on the screen and continue working on the input device, and completely black the screen out so that the attention is given to the front instead of the screen, both of which are highly useful in an education environment where keeping the attention of the class is one of the most important factors.</li>

				<p>The PN-80TC3 is marketed as the premium model and the flagship, whereas the PN-80SC5 is more marketed towards education offers better control over the screen with a blackout and freeze-frame button built into the screen.<br>The freeze-frame will pause whatever is on the screen at the time and let the controlling computer continue working, so if you want to leave a task on the screen but check you emails you can do so. The blackout button, blacks out the screen so the attention can be diverted away from the screen and to whoever is at the front.</p>
				<p>Another one of the major differences is that with the PN-80TC3 you can pair together two screens so you can have twice the space for documents, notes and having the displays interact with each other like it was one screen.</p>
