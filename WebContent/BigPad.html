<p>What is a Big Pad?</p>
<p>A Big Pad is a screen for offices and meeting rooms which will change how you conduct your meetings, with touchscreens, webcams and easy multi-tasking to make your life easier.</p>
<p>With screen sizes ranging from 40" to 80" so the screens can grow with the size that you need. If 80" is too small with the Big Pad Pro range you can link two screens together into one display to have almost 4 meters of screen!</p>
<p>With all<sup>1</sup> screens boasting touch screen with fast and responsive Infrared (IR) 10 point touch which means that up to four users can be interacting with one screen. As well as High Definition 1080p displays<sup>2</sup>.</p>
