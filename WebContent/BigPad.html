Both offer a "Pen-On-Paper" user experience with the extremely accurate and responsive touchscreen input, which provides a natural writing. Also with the Sharp Pen software you can convert handwritten notes into digital text, as well as hand drawn shapes and lines into graphics which means that you can provide everyone with the exact copy of the notes and they don't have to make their own, so they can be more focused on what is being talked about rather than making notes.<br></td>

<p>What are the main differences between the two models?</p>
<p>The PN-80TC3 is marketed as the premium model and the flagship, whereas the PN-80SC5 is more marketed towards education offers better control over the screen with a blackout and freeze-frame button built into the screen.<br>The freeze-frame will pause whatever is on the screen at the time and let the controlling computer continue working, so if you want to leave a task on the screen but check you emails you can do so. The blackout button, blacks out the screen so the attention can be diverted away from the screen and to whoever is at the front.</p>
<p>Another one of the major differences is that with the PN-80TC3 you can pair together two screens so you can have twice the space for documents, notes and having the displays interact with each other like it was one screen.</p>
