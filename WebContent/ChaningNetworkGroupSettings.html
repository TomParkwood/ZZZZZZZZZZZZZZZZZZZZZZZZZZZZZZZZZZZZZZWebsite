<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If your SMB scans cannot get through to your shared folder, or nobody on your network can see your machine. Your network settings maybe wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here's how to change your network group settings.<br /></span></p>
<p>{slider title="Windows 7" open="false" alias="Windows7"}</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One way to change this is to open control panel<sup>1</sup>, then go into network and internet, then finally into network and sharing centre<sup>2</sup>.<br />From here it will show the network you are connected to. It will show the name of the network then either Public, Work or Home network<sup>3</sup>. If the network is set to public it will not allow for any other devices on the network to connect to it, thus blocking the scans.<br />So change this to an appropriate one, then to check that it is working. Open up My Computer, then on the left select network, this will show all of the devices on the network as well as the printer<sup>4.</sup>.<br />So try sending a scan to the folder again.</span></p>

<p>{slider title="Windows 10" alias="Windows10"}<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One way to change this is to open the settings menu from the start menu.

At the top there should be a switch which says Find Devices and content, turn this on.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Now try sending a scan to the folder again, it should go through if it was the network settings which were wrong.</span></p>
