<p>All printers need drivers.</p>
<p>It is important to download and install the manufacturers driver.</p>
<p>This is because windows generic drivers are basic and often</p>
<p>hamper functionability of the printer.</p>
<p>Here are links to our machine ranges.</p>
<p>We recommend you use the PCL 6 driver if the option is available</p>
<p>and not opt for a universal driver</p>
<p>For older printers, most Windows 7 drivers will work with Windows 10</p>

<p>It is a good idea to let the drivers install using their own application.</p>
<p>Some of these are complete but some will just unzip onto your computer.</p>
<p>In this case you may need to set the printer manuallly.</p>
