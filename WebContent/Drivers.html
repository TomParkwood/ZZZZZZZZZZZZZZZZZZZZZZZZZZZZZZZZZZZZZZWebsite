	All printers need drivers<br>
	It is important to download and install the manufacturers driver, this is because the Windows generic drivers are basic and often hamper the funcationability of the printer.

<p>
	Here are some links to our machine ranges. We recommend that you use the PCL 6 driver if the option is available and not opt for a universal driver.<br>

	It is a good idea to let the drivers install themselves using their own application. However some only extract the files into a folder, so you will have to install the printer manually.<br>
	For older machines it maybe useful to know that most Windows 7 drivers will also work with Windows 10

<p>It is a good idea to let the drivers install using their own application.</p>
<p>Some of these are complete but some will just unzip onto your computer.</p>
<p>In this case you may need to set the printer manuallly.</p>
