<p>{slider title="How does it know what to call the files or folders?" open="false" alias="OCRBarcode"}</p>
<p>With the OCR or barcode modules they can be picked up from the document itself, so it can find the company name and create a folder for them, then look for the invoice number and give the file name invoiceXXXX, which means when someone goes to look for a specific invoice from that company all they have to do is look for the invoice number and its right there.</p>

<p>The most common use case for Drivve Image is to automate the archiving of invoices or job sheets. This can be done with as little user intervention as possible if the formatting for the forms are the same, this is so that it can pick up what type of document it is, and the specific details such as an invoice number.</p>
<p>Some people just like to use Drivve Image to clean up their scans, with tools which can de-skew the image, remove blobs (normally caused by hole-punches) and lines, or to simply automate the Bates stamping (annotation and pagination of the document) process, removing blank pages or simply automatically rotating the documents so the text is always the right way.</p>
