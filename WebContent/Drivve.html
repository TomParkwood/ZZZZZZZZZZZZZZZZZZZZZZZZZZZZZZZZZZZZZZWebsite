<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>What is a common use case for Drivve Image?</b></span></p>
<p>The most common use case for Drivve Image is to automate the archiving of invoices or job sheets. This can be done with as little user intervention as possible if the formatting for the forms are the same, this is so that it can pick up what type of document it is, and the specific details such as an invoice number.</p>
<p>Some people just like to use Drivve Image to clean up their scans, with tools which can de-skew the image, remove blobs (normally caused by hole-punches) and lines, or to simply automate the Bates stamping (annotation and pagination of the document) process, removing blank pages or simply automatically rotating the documents so the text is always the right way.</p>
<p>{slider title="How does it know what to call the files or folders?" open="false" alias="OCRBarcode"}</p>
<p>With the OCR or barcode modules they can be picked up from the document itself, so it can find the company name and create a folder for them, then look for the invoice number and give the file name invoiceXXXX, which means when someone goes to look for a specific invoice from that company all they have to do is look for the invoice number and its right there.</p>

<p>{slider title="Want to use a computer as well as the printer?" open="false" alias="DesktopClient"}</p>
<p>There is another version of Drivve which is intended to be installed on Desktops so instead of using Drivve via a printer you can do what you need to do on a computer which may be better for some people.</p>
<p>It can do as much as the version installed onto a printer can do and more, by not only working with newly scanned documents but also existing ones sat on the network, so all of the documents will be the same and no jump from the old to the new ones.</p>
