<p>Here is how to lock down paper trays for specific types of paper, whether that be coloured paper, letterhead or a thicker type of paper.</p>
<p>{slider title="Sharp MFP" open="false" alias="sharp"}</p>
<p>At the machine go into Settings then find Tray Settings, click on the tray which you wish to lock off. Change the paper type to the most appropriate such as letterhead or thick paper. Then turn off auto tray switching, this is so that if the machines runs out of paper in another tray of the same size it will not take the paper from this tray.</p>
<p>This also needs to be done on the printer driver as well, this is so you cannot print to this tray unless you specify that you want to print on letterhead or thick paper. To do this go into control panel then devices and then select printer. Right click on it and select Printer Properties (not just properties), then under the General tab click Preferences, then click Paper up the top, on the picture of the machine click the paper tray which you wish to lock off and change the paper type and click apply.</p>
<p>{slider title="Ricoh MFP" alias="ricoh"}</p>
<p>Please note we have only tested this on an Ricoh MP C306Z</p>
<p>This is done on the printer driver, so go into control panel then devices then printers and select the printer. Right click on it and then select Printer Properties (not just properties). Then under General click Preferences, then under detailed settings select Paper, then on Input Tray select the tray you want to change, then Paper Type select the most appropriate one and click apply. Just as a precaution go back to Frequently Used Settings for Normal Print and change input tray to the appropriate on, e.g. not the one you have just set up for letterhead or other types of paper.</p>
