<p>Sharp Huddle spaces allow you to conduct meetings quickly and productively with Big Pads and built in power and network points, so no matter your space constraints you can hold your meetings.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional meeting rooms which require lots of planning and the building of walls, with huddle spaces you can leave an open space and quickly put together your huddle space and when you move office take it with you.</p>
<p>Huddle spaces can be used for more informal meetings within the company to go over proceedings in a quick manner, so you don't have to book out a meeting room for five minutes for a quick chat or have it at your desk any more</p>
<p>One of the best features of Huddle spaces is how compact they are, whereas a meeting room is often quite large and often oversized a huddle space is smaller but still with ample desk and personal space when seated in it.</p>
