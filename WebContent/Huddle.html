	<p>Sharp Huddle spaces allow you to conduct meetings quickly and productively, with inbuilt Big Pads and power and network points, so no matter your space constraints you can hold meaningful meetings.<br>
	Unlike traditional meeting rooms which require lots of planning and permissions, huddle spaces can be moved around simply and even taken to new offices when required.<br>
	Huddle spaces are traditionally used for more informal meetings within the company to go over proceedings in a quick manner, so you don't need to book out a meeting room for a five minute discussion or have it at someones desk where people could overhear.<br>
	One of the best features of the huddle space is how compact they are, whereas a traditional meeting room is often much larger than it needs to be and often doesn't have modern features such as networking and a screen which can be easily connected to.<br>
	A huddle space takes up a fraction of the space of a meeting room and can still comfortably sit four to six people with a large touch screen at one end.<br>
