<p>Invu helps you keep on top of your digital records. It does this by keeping a central copy of the documents and everyone saves their work onto the central area.<br />Invu would benefit your company by keeping down storage costs by not having to have multiple copies of files on everyone's workstations. It also simplifies the backup procedure, instead of either having to rely on the user to make sure they backup their files, or have a large folder with all the users files and backing that up. <br />By having a centralised copy of the files it allows for everyone to know what the latest version is and that they aren't working on a file which has already been changed by someone else.<br />Invu also offer a wide range of addons which further expand the capabilities of the software, such as turning scanned documents into searchable and editable files which can also help to reduce data entry times by automating the procedure, an email manager which flags up if the job has already been done by another person or they are working on it thus ensuring that two people aren't doing the same job.</p>
