<p>{slider title="Is your printing costs spiraling out of control with seemingly no chance of it getting back under control easily?" open="false" alias="Costs"}</p>
<p>PaperCut offers the ability to track who is printing, this could be departments, individual users, or by printer.<br />You can assign print costs based on the printers consumables and easily be able to charge it to individuals or departments.<br />Did you know that PaperCut also offers an upgrade which makes it much easier to charge to customers so you can recoup printing costs for their printing.</p>
<p>{slider title="Do you suspect that employees are printing out much more than they should and are wasting toner on personal or prints that dont need to be printed?" alias="Wasting"}</p>
<p>Be able to keep an archive of all print jobs on the server, this shows what the document type is, the name of the document and for some file types a preview of what was printed.<br />This will show you if an employee who only ever works on spreadsheets is printing lots of personal printers so you can see why.<br />PaperCut also has scripting which allows for much more customisation of what can be done, one of the sample scripts is to bring up a warning message when prints are done single sided reminding employees that it is cheaper to print double sided, or to print to a cheaper running machine.<br />You can assign a limit to how much each user can print each month. So you can tell if a employee has printed too much if they run out of credit, and need to top up.<br />Although you could charge users for their excess printing over their quota it is very easy for an admin to login and add more to their account, or for the account to be able to keep printing even after going over the limit.<br />Because of how flexible the user interface is, instead of having a money value on pages printed you could have a number, and each page will decrement that number.</p>
<p>{slider title="Do you need flexibility in how your employees print and where they can? Do you want a single print queue which a user can go to any printer and collect their print from?" alias="Queue"}</p>
<p>One of the main features of PaperCut is that it allows for Follow Me printing, where the print job will sit on a secure server until it is requested by a machine then it will print out.<br />This can also be done across multiple different locations as long as the right hardware is in place. So if you have an office in London and Southampton, you can send a job to print in London and then collect when you are in Southampton.</p>
<p>{slider title="Do you want employees to be able to bring their own devices to work on but don't have the time or resources to setup printing for all of them?" alias="BYOD"}</p>
<p>Well PaperCut offers lots of flexibility in how print jobs are sent to the queue. Did you know that there is am app for phones which allow you to upload a document to print to your queue?<br />If you are using Google Docs for the majority of your work don't worry because PaperCut also fully supports Google Cloud Print. <br />As well as Email to Print, so you can simply send out an email to the address with how you want it to be printed and when you print it will be there waiting for you.<br />PaperCut also offers what it calls Mobility Printing, which is an easy way of ensuring that pretty much every device you could want to print from can. There are no drivers to install for the users and allows printing from pretty much any application.</p>
<p>{slider title="Do you need to be able to send out printing reports to another member of staff but simply can't find the spare time to do so, or don't even have the facility to simply get a report for all machines on your network?" alias="Reports"}</p>
<p>Well with PaperCut you can assign permissions to any user, so if you want Accounts to be able to have the reports for how much was spent on printing during the month you can just assign them the right to get the reports they want and when they want it without having to wait for someone else to do so.<br />Easily configurable reports which can be about pretty much anything that you would think PaperCut tracks, individual users printing, department printing, the printers that print the most.<br />These reports can be formatted in .pdf, .csv or .html so you can choose what is best for you, also reports can be configured to automatically run and send the result to an email address.</p>
<p>{slider title="Do you need easier control over who prints and where they can print?" alias="Control"}</p>
<p>PaperCut allows for control of individual users, this can be increasing their print quota on the fly, overriding print settings this is features like not having to authenticate themselves at the printer or having no restrictions on what they print. Allow a user to authenticate jobs from someone else, e.g. a PA getting the prints for their boss.<br />Most changes you can that you would think of would be already included within PaperCut but those which aren't can be done by adding custom scripts.</p>
