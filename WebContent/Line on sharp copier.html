<p>Sometime Lines may appear on your copier.</p>
<p>This can be caused by a number of things.</p>
<p>First thing to check. Is it only on copy mode?</p>
<p>Then, is it only when you use the document feeder?</p>
<p>If this is the case then there will be a small mark on the document feeder target glass, the thin</p>
<p>strip of glass to the left of the main glass.</p>
<p>Give this a good clean and you should be back in business.</p>
<p>If it is on both copy and print mode, the lines are being caused by a small bit of toner stuck to the</p>
<p>main charge unit. Sounds complicated? It is really easy to fix this and get you nice clean prints in minutes.</p>
<p>Open the front door, remove the waste toner container.</p>
<p>You will see a green rod attached inside the front door.</p>
<p>Remove this and inset it into the hole next to each of the four black plastic protruding items.</p>
<p>Once you have inserted and removed into each of the four holes, replace the waste toner, put the green rod back into the door and</p>
<p>carry on printing.If you are unable to cure lines with these procedures, please log a call out and we will come and sort it for you.</p>
