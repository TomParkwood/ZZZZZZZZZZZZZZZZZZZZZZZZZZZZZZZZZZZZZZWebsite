	We have found a common problem with a lot of OKI printers, that use the LED print system.<br>
	Sometimes the mono print will almost disappear or become somewhat hieroglyphic, we also see the colours either becoming offset to each other or completely vanishing.<br>
	This fix is simple.

	<li>Open the cover which shows the drums and toners.</li>
