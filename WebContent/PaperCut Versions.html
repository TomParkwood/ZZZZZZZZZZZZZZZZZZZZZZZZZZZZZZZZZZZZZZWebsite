<p>Do you know that there is two main versions of PaperCut which are offered? And what the differences are?<br /><br />There is currently two different versions of PaperCut which are offered which are targeted to different needs of organisations.<br />The simple version is PaperCut NG, which monitors and assigns cost to what is being printed.<br />This is useful where you want control over how much users can print and assigning rules on how print jobs are printed, such as only printing black and white as default and displaying a message when they try to print in colour.<br />One of the best features of PaperCut is that it isn't brand specific, so it will work on almost every single printer that can be connected to a network, not just the huge A3 MFPs.<br />PaperCut also allows for reports to be generated on almost anything which you can think of relating to printing, these reports can be set to automatically produce themselves and in multiple different formats such as .csv, .html and .pdf.<br /><br />The more advanced version of PaperCut is MF, this has all of the features of PaperCut NG but also enables a small application to be embedded within the photocopiers which allow for greater control over who has access to these devices.<br />Whereas PaperCut NG can only track the print jobs which have been sent to the print queue, PaperCut MF is able to track and monitor everything that is done on the machine once the user has logged in, this is copying, scanning and printing.<br />With having PaperCut embedded onto the photocopiers you can also have different methods of logins if you don't want to have to enter a username and password each time you want to authenticate your printing. This can be a pin code, multiple different ID cards and even biometric scanners. PaperCut tries to support as many authentication methods as possible to make it easier for you.<br />PaperCut doesn't limit you to one brand for embedding the application if you want to have a mix match of brands all with PaperCut embedded you can, it may not be as simple to setup but it can be done.</p>
