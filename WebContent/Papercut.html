<p>PaperCut is probably the most well known print management solution which exists. With features which offer functionality and customisation options to make PaperCut the right solution for you.</p>
<p>Make managing your printers much easier and centralised, so no matter what combinations of models and brands you have they will be supported in one way or another.</p>
<p>With PaperCut being able to be placed onto Windows, Linux and even Novell servers so you aren't forced to learn a new system when maintaining the servers.</p>
<p>The option to embed the software onto MFPs which will drastically improve how you manage your printing and ability to track all functionality of the machines, such as copying, scanning and even faxing.</p>
<p>If the accounts team keep asking why you are spening so much on printer supplies, you can customise reports which can be automatically sent out to the correct people in multiple different formats so they can easily slot into most workflows.</p>
<p>Makes setting up print privileges childs play, by syncing up to an Active Directory and updating every night means that once you have added the new account it can be on the system within minutes and by dropping them into groups 
which means that they will automatically gain all the permissions of everyone else in the group so no more having to individually change settings.</p>
<p>Being able to walk up to any printer on the network and print off your print queue is something which either sounds interesting or useless at the beginning but after using it for a period of time you will never want to go back.
No more having to send your print jobs to a specific printer just press print and walk up to any printer. Working in a different city tomorrow just login at the machine and your prints will come out.
No more having to resend your print jobs when the printer is down for maintenance, just go to the next closest one</p>
<p>No more worrying about being at the printer before anyone else is so they don't see the confidential contents of your documents, just walk up when you are ready and it will then print.
