<h1>Are you paying too much for your printing contracts?</h1>
<br>
<p>Did you know about development counters? and what the difference is between page counters and development counters?</p>
<br>
<p>Well a page count is how contracts should be setup, so when you press print and the document is black and white and A4 then it will increase the black and white page count by 1, an A3 page will increase the counter by 2. Likewise for colour, where if your print one colour page in A4 it will increase the colour count by 1.<br>
Whereas a development counters count for each drum which has turned, so a colour page will count for 4 pages, 1 for black and white and 3 for colours. This maybe why the print costs seem so low but in reality are very high once you add together all of the separate counts.<br>
For example an A3 colour page will end up costing you the price of two black pages and six colour pages, whereas on page counters you will only be charged for two colour pages.</p>
<p>There are ways to check how your contract is setup, one way is to look through the contract and see if it mentions it anywhere, another is to do a page count print and see if it matches your bills or if it specifically states that it is on page count or development count.</p>
