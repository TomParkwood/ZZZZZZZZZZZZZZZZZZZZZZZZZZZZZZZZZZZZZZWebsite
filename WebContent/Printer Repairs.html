<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Most office printers aren't cheap. In most cases, a full repair can be made for a fraction of the price of a new printer.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">We can repair most types of printer and multi function devices (formerly photocopiers)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">We operate in the Hampshire region but have contacts country wide</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Things to try before you get our help</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Most print quality problems in printers are cartridge problems especially with combined toner/drum cartridges. If you can, try another cartridge or even an old one to see if it makes a difference.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Call us for advice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">We are always happy to help. Please have the printer make and model and a good description of the fault. We may be able to cure it over the phone or point you to an easy user repair before you spend your money on a needless callout.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Why would we do this?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">We believe that good service will result in you calling us again in the future. We want to show you that our interest is in your machines continued functioning and not just our pocket.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Just one other thing.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">We no longer repair inkjet printers except for high value plotters and printers. Most inkjets these days are cheaper to replace than to repair.</span></strong></p>
