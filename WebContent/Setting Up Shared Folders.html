<p>If you want to setup scan to folder or share documents across your network you will need to setup a shared folder. This is actually easier than most people think.</p>
<p>When setting up scan to folder, we recommend creating a new folder on your desktop. You can do this by right clicking and then hover over new, then click folder. Give this new folder a sensible name such as Scans. However these steps can be performed on existing folders.

<p>Right click on this folder and select properties, under the tabs at the top select Sharing, then click the Share... button. In the textbox enter everyone then click Add. Under Permission Level for everyone click on it and then change it to Read/Write then click Share. It will open a screen which should say Your folder is shared, you can click Done.</p>

<p>Back on the folder's properties in sharing there will be a Network Path:, make a note of this including the \\ because this is the folder you will enter when setting up Scan to folder.</p>
