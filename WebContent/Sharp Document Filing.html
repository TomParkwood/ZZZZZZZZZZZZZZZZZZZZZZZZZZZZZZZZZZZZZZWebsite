<p>Setting up Document Filing isn't hard and can be easily setup so those documents you need to print often are stored on the machine or a file you know you will need soon but don't want to print off just yet.</p>
<p>You will need to have the proper Sharp Driver installed otherwise this feature will not appear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firstly you will need to open the document you wish to hold at the machine.</p>
<p>File and print, make sure that you have the correct printer selected.</p>
<p>{slider title=" " open="false" alias="1" class="icon"}</p>

<p>Click Printer Properties. Be aware that Outlook is slightly different, being that you select the printer, then you have to click Print Options, then Properties.</p>
<p>{slider title=" " open="false" alias="2" class="icon"}</p>

<p>Up the top click Job Handling, then click Retention. Make sure it is on Hold only in Retention Settings, and Main Folder in Document Filing Settings.</p>

<p>If the document you are storing on the machine is confidential then you want to click on Password and enter a six digit code, you will need this code when you want to print the document out.</p>
<p>{slider title=" " open="false" alias="4" class="icon"}</p>

<p>When you are ready to collect your print, walk up to the machine and select document filing from the top. (Most machines are left in copy)</p>
<p>{slider title=" " open="false" alias="5" class="icon"}</p>

<p>{/sliders}</p>
<p>Press Main Folder, and find the job which matches the one you sent to the machine. If you password protected the document then you will need to enter the code now</p>
<p>{slider title=" " open="false" alias="6" class="icon"}</p>

<p>{/sliders}</p>
<p>You can either select Print and Hold or Print and Delete. Print and Hold will print the document but keep the file in the folder so you can print again later if necessary, whereas Print and Delete will delete the document from the folder once it has been printed</p>
