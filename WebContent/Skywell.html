<p>What is Skywell?</p>
<p>Simply it makes water from air.<br />No plumbing needed, only power. Meaning that it can be wheeled to where it needs to be and left, no having to get a plumber in to run water pipes over to it.</p>
<p>Surely it doesn't generate enough for an office?</p>
<p>While Skywell may not provide enough fresh water to satisfy a large office full of heavy drinkers, it does supply up to 18 litres of fresh water per day, enough to quench the thirst of 10 average usage office staff.</p>
<p>As well as generating the water, it will also heat or chill the water on demand, so if you want kettle temperature water or water like it's been sat in the fridge all day you can. It can supply from 3°C to around 98°C, which is more than enough for a hot cup of tea and a refreshing drink.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Why would you want a Skywell?</p>
<p>Some people have health concerns about drinking out of plastic containers, so the big jugs of water which are commonplace at water machines are out. Many water machines don't get cleaned as often as they should, and although most machines say that they filter and clean the water they don't do a very good job of it or the filters are never replaced. By replacing plastic jugs and allowing employees to save on plastic bottles purchases you will help to reduce the amount of waste plastic in the environment.<br /> <br /> What can a Skywell do that a normal water machine can't do?</p>
<p>Current water machines don't allow for the adjustment of the water temperature on screen, they normally offer cold or warm water. Also if you noticed on the screen there is a 8 inch touch panel, instead of only displaying what temperature it can dispense at, the screen can be configured to do a whole range of clever things such as displaying how full its tank is, how many plastic bottles you have saved. Not just this it can also be used for marketing which can be controlled by you, so you can display any marketing material you want on it. In a reception area this can be used to highlight key areas of your business or anything you may want to show off.<br /> <br /> The water is generated from the air, it must taste horrible.</p>
<p>Once the water has been condensed it is then meticulously filtered it to remove the contaminants from the water, it has five filters and two UV bulbs to ensure that the water which is dispensed is as clean as possible, and substantially cleaner and free of contaminants than tap water or many bottled water offerings. You can be assured that you are getting the freshest water possible. With the five filters which are replaced as part of the service support, you can be assured that the quality of water which you are receiving is the best and cleanest possible.</p>
